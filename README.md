# BehaviorNetSim
In sea ecology, there is an interesting question about the determinant factors of interactions of preys and predators with the dynamics of the environment. In the interdisciplinary study, we developed a heap-based discrete event simulation, studied the mutually inhibited behavior-model simulation and its application in sea ecology, and developed a GUI-based controller for the behavior-model simulation with the real time behavior analysis data in dynamic charts.
