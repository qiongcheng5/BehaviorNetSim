Version 1

In sea ecology, there is an interesting question about the determinant factors of interactions of preys and predators with the dynamics of the environment. In the interdisciplinary study, we developed a heap-based discrete event simulation, studied the mutually inhibited behavior-model simulation and its application in sea ecology, and developed a GUI-based controller for the behavior-model simulation with the real time behavior analysis data in dynamic charts.
